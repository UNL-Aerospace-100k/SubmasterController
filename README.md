# SubmasterController
For programming the Arduino NANO on the remote test site board

The Arduino NANO recieves UART from an XBEE and determines what actions should be performed. The device can set any of four possible relays (only two at the moment), or can tell the SensorMonitor to begin recording data on its GPIO with a simple pulse.

Keep updating this code as well as the SensorMonitor, it works great with the test stand.
